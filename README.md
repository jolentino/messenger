<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Description

This full-stack app is designed to model social media login pages. It processes user-generated credentials delivered to and from a cloud database. It features a standard, two-page layout for registering an account and logging into an account. Passwords are safely encrypted before database storage. Once an account is created or a user is logged in, the session persists through cookie-based authentication.
